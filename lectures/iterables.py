## Iterables = An object/collection that can return its elements one at a time,
#              allowing it to be iterated over in a loop

# numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
#
# for number in reversed(numbers):
#     print(number)

# numbers = (1,2,3,4,5)
#
# for number in reversed(numbers):
#     print(number)

# fruits={"apple","orange","banana"}
# #sets are not reversible
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruits)
